## 🚀 The Problem vs. The Signal
Most teams already have the data. **They just don’t have clarity.**

Founders are drowning in qualitative feedback across emails, Discord, and support tickets.
SignalBox helps you answer:
> * "What should we build next?"
> * "Is this issue actually important or just loud?"
> * "Are paying users asking for different things than free users?"

It is built for **signal, not noise**.
