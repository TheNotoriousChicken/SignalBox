SignalBox

Know what your users want — without digging through feedback.

SignalBox is a calm, founder-first feedback intelligence tool that turns scattered user feedback into clear, actionable product insights.

Instead of manually reading emails, Discord messages, and support tickets, SignalBox automatically detects patterns, highlights what’s rising, and connects feedback directly to product decisions.

🚀 What SignalBox Does

SignalBox helps SaaS founders and product teams:

Collect feedback from multiple sources (Email, Discord, Intercom, etc.)

Automatically group similar feedback into Insights

Detect trends, spikes, and declining issues

Track which insights turn into roadmap decisions

Stay informed without notification overload

It’s built for signal, not noise.

🧠 The Core Idea

Most teams already have the data.
They just don’t have clarity.

SignalBox answers questions like:

What should we build next?

Is this issue actually important or just loud?

Are paying users asking for different things than free users?

Which feedback turned into shipped features?
